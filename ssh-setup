Additional Troubleshooting
Firewall: If you have a firewall enabled (like UFW), make sure to allow SSH connections.

#############################
sudo ufw allow ssh
Check SSH Configuration: If you still face issues, you can check the SSH configuration file:

##############
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Ensure the configuration file is correctly set up for your needs. After making changes, restart the SSH service:

###################

sudo systemctl restart ssh
Summary
By following these steps, you will install and start the SSH service on your Ubuntu VM. You should then be able to connect from another machine using SSH. If you continue to face issues, ensure that the network configuration between the two machines is correct and that no firewalls are blocking SSH traffic.
