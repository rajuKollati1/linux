The error message "Unit ssh.service could not be found" indicates that the SSH server is not installed on your Ubuntu VM. To resolve this, you'll need to install the SSH server package, which is openssh-server. Here's how you can do it:

Step-by-Step Instructions to Install and Start SSH Service
Update Package Lists
Before installing any new package, it's a good practice to update the package lists to ensure you have the latest version of packages and their dependencies.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
Install OpenSSH Server
Install the SSH server package (openssh-server) using apt.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install openssh-server
Verify SSH Service Installation
After installation, verify that the SSH service is installed correctly.

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status ssh
If installed, this command should show the status of the SSH service.

Start and Enable SSH Service
Start the SSH service and enable it to run on boot.

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
Check the Status Again
Check the status again to ensure the SSH service is running properly.

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status ssh
Check SSH Port (Optional)
By default, SSH runs on port 22. Ensure that port 22 is open and listening.

bash
Copy code
sudo ss -tuln | grep 22
You should see an entry like LISTEN on port 22, indicating the SSH service is up and running.

Additional Troubleshooting
Firewall: If you have a firewall enabled (like UFW), make sure to allow SSH connections.

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow ssh
Check SSH Configuration: If you still face issues, you can check the SSH configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Ensure the configuration file is correctly set up for your needs. After making changes, restart the SSH service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Summary
By following these steps, you will install and start the SSH service on your Ubuntu VM. You should then be able to connect from another machine using SSH. If you continue to face issues, ensure that the network configuration between the two machines is correct and that no firewalls are blocking SSH traffic.
